# Minesweeper
Classic minesweeper (customizable size and number of bombs, chording available)
- Left click on a covered tile to open it
- Right click on a covered tile to flag it
- Chording: if an opened numbered tile has the same number of flags around it (eg: there is a "5" tile with 5 flags surrounding it), left clicking on that tile will open all surrounding unflagged covered tiles
- F5 to restart

Future plans
- Implement a "first click is always safe" version
- Implement a guess-free version (guessing is always unnecessary)
- Implement a Minesweeper solver (probably needed for the guess-free version)
- Implement a cruel-but-fair version (necessary guesses are always safe, but punishes for unnecessary guessing)
