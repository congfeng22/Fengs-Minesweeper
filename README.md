# Minesweeper
Classic minesweeper (customizable size and number of bombs, chording available)
- Left click on a covered tile to open it
- Right click on a covered tile to flag it
- Chording: if an opened numbered tile has the same number of flags around it (ie: there is a "5" tile with 5 flags surrounding it), left clicking on that tile will open all surrounding unflagged covered tiles
- F5 to restart
